# batstuff

Set up:
1. Go to _example.bat
2. Set variable values

Good to know:
- Keep _main as it is, it's not meant to be altered (unless you want to add or change functionality)
- Set browser paths in _main-browser (ex C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer)

Variable explanation:
* proj = project name
* trunk = path to VS-solution 
* trunkExplorer = path to project in file explorer
* trunkWeb = local web address (http://example.local etc)
* projPort = port number. Not critical, but good to know sometimes
