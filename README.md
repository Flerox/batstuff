# batstuff

Set up:
- Go to _example.bat
- Set variable values

Good to know:
- Keep _main as it is, it's not meant to be altered (unless you want to add or change functionality)
- Set browser paths in _main-browser (ex C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer)

Variable explanation:
* slnPath = path to VS-solution 
* folderPath = path to project in file explorer
* webAddress = local web address (http://example.local etc)
* port = port number. Not critical, but good to know sometimes
