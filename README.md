Good to know:
- Keep _main as it is, it's not meant to be altered (unless you want to add or change functionality)
- Set paths in _main-browser

How to:
- Duplicate _example, give it a suitable name and change the variables
proj = project name
trunk = path to VS-solution 
trunkExplorer = path to project in file explorer
trunkWeb = local web address (http://example.local etc)
projPort = port number. Not critical, but good to know sometimes
